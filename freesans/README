# FreeSans Font for Octave/GNUplot

This folder contains the FreeSans font files needed for Octave to generate plots with gnuplot in headless Docker environments.

## Problem Solved

When running Octave in Docker containers, gnuplot often fails to find system fonts, causing plot generation to fail with errors like:
- `warning: ft_manager: unable to load font: /usr/share/fonts/opentype/freefont/FreeSansBold.otf`
- `warning: ft_text_renderer: unable to load appropriate font`

## Solution

This folder provides the FreeSans.otf font file that:
1. Gets copied into the Docker container at `/usr/share/fonts/opentype/freefont/`
2. Is registered with the system using `fc-cache -fv`
3. Allows gnuplot to find and use the font for generating PNG images

## Usage

The font is automatically installed when building the Docker image via the Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
COPY freesans/ /usr/share/fonts/opentype/freefont/
RUN fc-cache -fv
```
